# Bug Finder

Very similar to 3-Review-Pull-Requests.md

Its experimental and checks the current @diff using internal prompts and optimizations done by cursor (no one knows what exactly) for potential bugs.

Give it a try. Could be that this feature will be removed in the future. I had mixed results.
