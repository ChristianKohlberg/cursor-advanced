# State Machine

In many cases we get some states from the backend and have a tough time to show the correct rendering depending on the available combinations. AI can guide us very fast to create a matrix list and then implement the UI decisions with a `Switch Case` or `Sub Classing` approach to show the proper content.

```typescript
// Enum-like type for Order Status
type OrderStatus =
  | 'pendingConfirmation'
  | 'processing'
  | 'shipped'
  | 'delivered'
  | 'cancelled';

// Enum-like type for Payment Status
type PaymentStatus = 'pending' | 'paid' | 'failed' | 'refunded';

interface Order {
  id: number;
  orderStatus: OrderStatus;
  paymentStatus: PaymentStatus;
}
```

## Prompt

Please generate a matrix listing all possible combinations of `orderStatus` and `paymentStatus`. For each combination, suggest potential UI rendering considerations or states. Additionally, outline how these combinations could be handled in a UI using either a `Switch Case` statement or a `Sub Classing` approach, explaining the pros and cons of each method in this specific scenario.
