# AI-Generated Commit Messages

Cursor provides built-in functionality to automatically generate commit messages using AI. When you stage changes and initiate a commit, Cursor analyzes the diff of your changes and uses AI to generate a descriptive commit message that summarizes what was modified.

Currently, there are no customization options available for the AI commit message generation - it uses Cursor's default prompt and model settings to create the commit message.

For more details, see the [Cursor documentation on AI commit messages](https://docs.cursor.com/more/ai-commit-message).
