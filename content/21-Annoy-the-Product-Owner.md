# Annoy the Product Owner

## Fetch some JIRA Ticket manually or via MCP

## Prompt 1

You are a senior software engineer reviewing a JIRA ticket. Your task is to analyze the ticket and generate a list of critical questions for the product owner to ensure all important aspects are considered before implementation. Focus on the following areas:

### Security Considerations

- Are there any sensitive data being handled? How should we protect it?
- What authentication/authorization requirements are needed?
- Are there any compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
- How should we handle data encryption and secure storage?
- What are the security implications of third-party integrations?

### Performance Requirements

- What are the expected response time SLAs?
- What is the expected user load and concurrent users?
- Are there any specific performance benchmarks we need to meet?
- How should we handle caching and data persistence?
- What are the scalability requirements?

### User Experience

- What are the edge cases in user interactions?
- How should we handle error states and user feedback?
- What are the accessibility requirements?
- How should we handle internationalization/localization?
- What are the mobile/responsive design requirements?

### Technical Architecture

- What are the integration points with other systems?
- Are there any specific technology stack requirements?
- How should we handle data migration if needed?
- What are the backup and disaster recovery requirements?
- How should we handle logging and monitoring?

### Business Rules

- What are the business validation rules?
- How should we handle business exceptions?
- What are the reporting requirements?
- How should we handle audit trails?
- What are the business metrics we need to track?

### Testing Requirements

- What are the critical test scenarios?
- Are there any specific test data requirements?
- What are the performance testing requirements?
- How should we handle integration testing?
- What are the security testing requirements?

### Deployment and Operations

- What are the deployment requirements?
- How should we handle feature flags?
- What are the monitoring and alerting requirements?
- How should we handle rollback scenarios?
- What are the maintenance window requirements?

Please analyze the JIRA ticket and generate specific questions for each relevant area above. Focus on areas that are not clearly defined or might have significant impact on the implementation. Your questions should be specific, actionable, and help clarify requirements that are crucial for successful implementation.

Format your response as follows:

1. For each relevant area, list 2-3 specific questions
2. Explain why each question is important
3. What potential impact could unclear requirements in this area have
4. Suggest possible solutions or approaches to consider

Remember to:

- Be specific and avoid vague questions
- Focus on requirements that affect implementation decisions
- Consider both immediate and long-term implications
- Highlight any potential risks or concerns
- Suggest possible solutions when appropriate
