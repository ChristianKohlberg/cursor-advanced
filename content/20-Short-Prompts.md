# Short Prompts

Favor short prompts over long prompts. Be very cautious with AI generated prompts which do not stem from a self-written prompt from a human.

It often ends up in:

- Increased hallucination
- Becoming verbose
- Increased complexity in proposed solutions

Things which had been previously recommended like:

- Act like a React Expert...
- Act like a Designer

Sometimes do work just fine and sometimes seem to overfit as the underlying model already is properly aligned and trained to handle the complexity at hand.

Instead:

1. View results and start to steer the llm model through follow-up questions.

2. When the implementation is done, ask the AI how it would describe the work which it has done conceptually and use this reference for future work.
