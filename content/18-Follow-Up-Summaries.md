# Follow-Up-Summaries.md

Consider you have a long lasting conversation and implemented the first feature. Context gets out of hand, potentially pricey and maybe the existing conversation could get in the way with the next feature at hand.

Wrap up your implementation with a prompt which you can then use in the next conversation as input.

## Prompt

Please summarize our previous conversation and implementation:

1. What we built
2. How we built it (key technical decisions)
3. Current state and limitations
4. Next steps

Keep it concise but include any critical details needed to continue development.
