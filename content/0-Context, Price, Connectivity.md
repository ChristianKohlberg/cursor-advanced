# Intro

## Context

The more context you can add, the better the results. Keep in mind that High Quality Context is strictly better than low quality in high quantity.

## Price

Models arent cheap to run. They look cheap to begin with, but 20$/month for Cursor is more of an entry fee and no total cost of ownership. My ballpark here is that you spend more like 200-400$/month for each developer, depending on terms like usage and tooling availability.

Keep an eye on it.

## Connectivity

MCP Protocol is great, its convenient to get access to JIRA Tickets, Pull Requests, Figma Designs, Databases, APIs and more. Its an upfront investment though to get it sorted out and have it properly in place.

**in the current time there is a MCP server or SaaS for everything AI related.**
